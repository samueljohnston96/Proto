To run this program first compile this program using the gradle task "jar".
Next simply place the txnlog.dat file inside of the same directory as the jar file (should be in the Proto/build/libs
directory), and run "java -jar Proto.jar".  It will output the counts, totals, and user information.  This is made with
java 1.8 so for this to properly run please use java 1.8 or later (although it *should* run fine with 1.5 or above,
there may be unintended consequences since this was tested with java version 1.8).

The input file must be named txnlog.dat since the filename is hard coded currently.  To fix this would be simple and
would just require parsing of the program arguments and having the user pass in the file name.  Since this was not
required and would add unneeded complexity to running the program I have left it out.
